### About me
I am from [Tianjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin). I use `python`, `java`, `c`, and `c++`. Besides tedious coding, I love scuba diving, painting; I play with cameras and drones; I am fascinated with gears, planes, and rockets.

### Why ece16
I am currently in a rocket lab, where I find out hardware can be super fun. I want to learn more about hardware and someone said ece16 is a cool project class for you to get started.
