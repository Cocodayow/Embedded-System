# Keybinds

## DS1

### Challenge 2:

Here are some exploratory questions we asked our customer:



**1. Is it a remote that you hold in your hand, or does it sit stationary on a table?**

It should be held in the hand

**2. Should it have buttons or a touchscreen?**

Buttons

**3. Is it plugged in or is it cordless?** (Bluetooth/USBA)

It is wireless and should use bluetooth

**4. What is a good size for the device? How many buttons should it have?**

It should be smaller than a 13 mini, and all buttons should be easily accessible. The buttons should be pretty easy to press.

**5. How many buttons do you want? What do you think is a good number?**

At minimum, a 2x2 grid of buttons. Whats most important is that "I just have to be able to reach it".

**6. What feel should it have? Any particular design?**

Any color works. Good feeling plastic.

**7. What applications do you expect to be using it for?**

Clips studio. Mostly for switching brushes and pressing undo/redo. It will mostly be used for pressing buttons, not for holding them down.

**8. Should the keybinds be static or should it change per application?**

Applications have individual keybind settings. I prefer it to switch automatically.

**9. Anything else that feels important for the product?**

Low latency

**10. How should the buttons feel?**

They should be easy to press, and it is important for them to be placed so I can press all of them.

#### Background search

We found there are small programmable keyboards available for purchase, and there are multiple sizes but there isn't one with 2x2 size as required by the customer. Also, most of them use mechanical keyboard which is not as portable as the customer required. The customer would like a 2x2 size because she wants her hand able to reach all the keys. Many existing keyboards can't switch automatically between apps, and the connections are not stable. Some don't support bluetooth. Some's key dial doesn't support multi-key presses, meaning that each key on mini controller must be the only key on keyboard, it can't be a combination.

### Challenge 3:

The metrics that we chose to track with the Kano model include:

- Low latency - *Linear*
- Automatic keybind switching - *Exciter*
- Physical keybind toggle - *Satisfier*
- Battery powered - *Satisfier*
- Good amount of buttons - *Linear*

### Post-Survey Findings

The method we chose to run the survey was a google form. We surveyed 10 people, with each team member contributing three people, plus the client. The results showed that there is a need for this product, at least within our survey of respondents. This is likely because the product doesn't present any questionable features that would turn away customers. Additionally, the need to have easily accessible keybinds doesn't only exist with drawing, but generally for navigating menus more effectively.
