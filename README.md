# ECE16

In this class we are introduced to the process of solving real world needs by designing smart sensorized devices. 

We learn a wide gamut of hardware and software prototyping tools including microcontroller, electronic circuits/sensors/actuators, and a taste of machine learning/computer vision. 

There are lab assignments which will all be very hands-on

For the final project, we designed a customizable keybind, it remembers the shortcuts on the keyboard, and makes it eaiser for games and other softwares.
