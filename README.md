# ECE16

In this class we are introduced to the process of solving real world needs by designing smart sensorized devices. We learnt a wide gamut of hardware and software prototyping tools including microcontroller, electronic circuits/sensors/actuators, and a taste of machine learning/computer vision. 

## Lab assignments

Contains reports for hands-on assignments such as walk detectors and shake detectors.

## Final project 

Contains design and development files for a custom keybinds controller. The controller is designed to be used in the left hand and can rest on a table, featuring at least 4 programmable buttons. It connects to a computer via Bluetooth or USB-A, offering a convenient solution for drawing and gaming while on voice calls with friends.
